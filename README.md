George Syntax Highlighting
========================

George Syntax Highlighting for vim

Setup
-----
To install this custom syntax highlighting, copy the `syntax/george.vim` file to your `.vim/syntax/` directory.

You can now activate the syntax highlighting via the vim command `set syntax=george`

For automatic file detection, copy the `ftdetect/george.vim` file to your `.vim/ftdetect/` directory. It will mark all files ending in `.grg` as George files.

"Options"
---------
You can uncomment (or comment) various pieces of the syntax to enable (or disable) various pieces of highlighting.

Your milage may vary. :P
